    - Generate Project ConfigFile - (2-17-20)[Done]
    - Generate ChangeLog File (Maybe grab directly from Github)
    - Generate .gitignore
    - Generate New Module (Run in empty directory and it will create common file such as variables.tf, main.tf, outputs.tf, etc..)
    - Generate Outputs (Can we call or easily find and scrape a terraform page with some beautify soup?) 
      - Yes, Terraform appears to have a standard https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket.html where the resource would be aws_s3_bucket so just remove aws_ from each of the resources and put in URL path.
    - Generate Github Action for the project.
    - Generate CloudFormation Template to instantiate Secure Bucket, IAM Role, DynamoTable etc..
  - WishList:
    - Securely Store Token (So it doesn't have to be provided on each run)
    - Allow User to supply their own Jinja Template, Document all collected data and available variables that can be used within the template. - (2-17-20)[Done]
    - Add Input Argument for TF Directory to run against (tf = Terraform(working_dir='/home/test') - (2-17-20)[Done]


PatchList:
  - create doc needs a backup flag that will toggle backups off.
  - create needs template option to allow passing custom template
  - Need to sync create capabilities with available option flags in the create command.
